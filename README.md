# Wallpapers

A curated collection of wallpapers I use across my machines.
Mostly minimal, abstract, or nature-themed images that fit well with
lightweight desktop environments.

## Usage

You can use any standard wallpaper utility to set these images as your
background.
Here are some common tools for different window managers and setups:
